# Lizzie's Team READme

### About Me/ My Job 
My job first and foremost is to be your first line of defense to make sure y'all can do **your** job well. One of my biggest challenges is that because there's *soo* much going on all the time, smaller things may get pushed down the list to deal with Today's Crisis. Don't let me do this! I really appreciate folks who manage up. Please remind me where I'm acting as a road block instead of an assist, that's something that I assure you is never intentional! Advance planning and documentation is also really helpful here -- if I know in advance what's coming up, or if there's somewhere I can quickly catch up on what's been happening, I'll be better equiped to help out. 

I believe in work-life balance -- you work hard when you're on the clock or when you have to, but down time is important too. I enjoy keeping work light, so sometimes it may seem like I'm being flippant about something when I'm actually taking it serious and just cracking jokes. Part of making room for the non-work stuff is empowering people to learn how to tackle things on their own. One of the biggest parts of my job is helping people understand the "why" and "how" about what they're doing. This strategy can create a little more work up front, but it pays off down the road when you've created more allies who can spread your "whys" and "hows" for you. 

### Preferred Communication Method
Since our team has Slack while many others do not, I prefer it as the immediate communication tool -- ideal for if you're running late for a meeting, have a quick question, or want to share a funny joke. I tend to use Slack conversationally, and may share things out of order or send 4 messages when one long one would have done the trick. 

I also prefer Slack for code sharing, since Slack does a nice job of formatting code blocks for readability. 

To me, email is a formal communication tool. I expect project updates and requests, especially from other departments, to be handled on email. Email is also really important for those more, er, challenging projects to get everyone on the same page and document outcomes from meetings and process updates. In my eyes, email is official, Slack is conversational. 

If we're talking about a scheduled event of any kind(phone call, in-person, conference), SEND A CALENDAR INVITE. I live and die off my calendar, if it's not in there, I won't remember it's happening.

### Personal Intention for Planning Day
I'm really looking forward to hearing more about everyone's self-described work styles. As a team, we spend so much time responding to other people's reqeuests that it'll be a treat to have the day to focus on just our team and clearing space to make sure our goals don't get lost in the day-to-day.  

### Personal Principles / Values
I assume everyone comes into the workplace with best intentions. Sometimes we have bad days, but even in bad cases you perform and behave professionally. If you can't do that for whatever reason, go home. Everyone needs a mental health day every once in a while. I expect you'll let me know when you feel like those once-in-a-whiles are starting to get more frequent. I'm happy to help where it's needed, but if you're asking for my assistance, I assume it's because you've already tried finding the answer yourself and/or by asking your coworkers for their advice. 

## Optional Responses

### You: OOO
Outside of work, I help run the [Code for DC Meetup](codefordc.org), a volunteer group of folks who use technical skills of all levels to help solve problems around the DC area. It's a lot of work but a lot of fun and a cool way to mix tech and do-gooderism ðŸ’»âœŠ I also sail on a variety of big and small boats on weekends; this summer I'll be going to an international competition in Nova Scotia! I also love old movies (I watch a ton of TCM) and board game nights with friends.

### Things you should know about me
I function my best when I get 8+ hours of sleep a night. I get distracted easily and want to have a good time, so sometimes I have to lock myself away in my office to make sure that I'm getting what I need to do handled. I'm not intentionally hiding from you, I just need to be able to carve out some time to get things off my plate so I can help you all with yours.
