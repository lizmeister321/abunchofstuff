### About Me/ My Job 
My job first and foremost is to be your first line of defense to make sure y'all can do **your** job well. One of my biggest challenges is that because there's so much going on all the time, I may get pulled into  last-minute requests from managers or other teams. My goal is to not let your work get pushed down the list to deal with Today's Crisis; this is not always a reality though and I try to be transparent about when I am on deadline. I really appreciate folks who manage up, so if you find your projects keep slipping off my radar, flag it for me! It is almost assuredly unintentional.  Advance planning and documentation is also really helpful here -- if I know in advance what's coming up, or if there's somewhere I can quickly catch up on what's been happening, I'll be better equipped to help out. 

Now that we are remote, I rely on you all to be the owners of your calendar. You are the primary person in charge of your JIRA tickets, your inbox, and your schedule. I rely on tools like JIRA to see what you’re up to on a daily basis. I trust you all to be adults and complete your work on time in the way you see best fit. However, this is a two way street and I expect you all to keep me informed by responding to emails in a timely fashion, keeping your calendar up to date, and putting your work on JIRA, GitHub and Slack where appropriate. 
I believe in work-life balance -- you work hard when you're on the clock or when you have to, but down time is important too. I enjoy keeping work light, so sometimes it may seem like I'm being flippant about something when I'm actually taking it serious and just cracking jokes. Part of making room for the non-work stuff is empowering people to learn how to tackle things on their own. One of the biggest parts of my job is helping people understand the "why" and "how" about what they're doing. This strategy can create a little more work up front, but it pays off down the road when you've created more allies who can spread your "whys" and "hows" for you. 

### Preferred Communication Method
Since our team has Slack while many others do not, I prefer it as the immediate communication tool -- ideal for if you're running late for a meeting, have a quick question, or want to share a funny joke. I tend to use Slack conversationally, and may share things out of order or send 4 messages when one long one would have done the trick. I also prefer Slack for code sharing, since Slack does a nice job of formatting code blocks for readability. 

Lately I’ve found Teams to be a better tool for video calling, as the Slack call tool is glitchy a lot of the time.
To me, email is a formal communication tool. I expect project updates and requests, especially from other departments, to be handled on email. Email is also really important for those more, er, challenging projects to get everyone on the same page and document outcomes from meetings and process updates. Many of our senior leaders and affiliate staff use email and I expect myself and my team to respond with the same level of formality and attention (which includes promptness) that you would give them in person. This means full sentences, detailed and clear replies, and checks for typos. 

In my eyes, email is official, Slack is conversational. 

**If we're talking about a scheduled event of any kind (phone call, in-person, conference), SEND A CALENDAR INVITE. I live and die off my calendar, if it's not in there, I won't remember it's happening.**

### Personal Intention for Planning Day
This has been a weird year, and I have never had to onboard remotely before, so I’m looking forward to getting to sit down with everyone for a day and talk about the team in the big picture helps me get a better understanding of all of you and how we fit together as a group. 

### Personal Principles / Values
I assume everyone comes into the workplace with best intentions. Sometimes we have bad days, but even in bad cases you perform and behave professionally. If you can't do that for whatever reason, go home. Everyone needs a mental health day every once in a while. I expect you'll let me know when you feel like those once-in-a-whiles are starting to get more frequent. I'm happy to help where it's needed, but if you're asking for my assistance, I assume it's because you've already tried finding the answer yourself and/or by asking your coworkers for their advice. 

## Optional Responses

### You: OOO
Outside of work, [I love to sail]( https://www.instagram.com/p/B1woSJpg1xg/) on a variety of big and small boats on weekends, mostly smaller boats these days. When travel becomes a thing again, I’ll likely travel a fair amount in the summer to go to regattas, hopefully all the way to Wales! I also love old movies (I love my Criterion Collection subscription more than most things) and cooking. I’m a big fan of Guy Fieri; it started ironically but I don’t think I’m joking any more. 
Since we’ve been home more, I’ve been playing a lot of board games – my  new favorite is 7 Wonders and the 2-player version, 7 Wonders Duel. I am starting to get more into RPGs and even joined a Dungeons and Dragons game a friend put together. I’m not very good but I’m trying! 

### Things you should know about me
I function my best when I get 8+ hours of sleep a night. I get distracted easily and want to have a good time, so sometimes I have to lock myself away from calls/emails to make sure that I'm getting what I need to do handled. I'm not intentionally hiding from you, I just need to be able to carve out some time to get things off my plate so I can help you all with yours.
